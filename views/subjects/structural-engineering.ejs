    <h1>Structural Engineering</h1>
    <p>
      Structural Engineering focuses on the analysis and design of structures
      that safely support loads and resist forces such as gravity, wind, and earthquakes.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Structural engineering ensures buildings, bridges, and infrastructures
      remain stable and safe throughout their lifespan. It applies physics,
      mathematics, and material science.
